To move the robot in a tiny square pattern, I will create a plan that involves moving forward, then turning right, and repeating this sequence to form a square. Each side of the square will be short, and the turns will be 90 degrees.

Here's the plan:

1. Move forward at a speed of 0.5 for 1 second.
2. Turn right at a speed of 0.5 for 1 second.
3. Move forward at a speed of 0.5 for 1 second.
4. Turn right at a speed of 0.5 for 1 second.
5. Move forward at a speed of 0.5 for 1 second.
6. Turn right at a speed of 0.5 for 1 second.
7. Move forward at a speed of 0.5 for 1 second.
8. Turn right at a speed of 0.5 for 1 second.

I will now execute this plan step-by-step. Let's begin with the first step.
